#Inventory Manager

by David Roberts

Inventory Manager is a web application designed to automatically generate inventory reports for small businesses. Users can upload inventory data files (.txt or .csv) or manually enter data. The app then organizes products by product category, or product upc code and compiles a report that the business owner can have.

The front-end was desigined with a mobile experience in mind so that app users could tabulate data as they run an inventory count. On a mobile device, users can enter item categories and price, or scan a UPC code which will then call on a product database to refer back a product name and brand. Once all items are entered, a user can print a pdf report of the current inventory count and historical inventory trends. Report charts were generated with Google Visualization API
